I’ve been surprised about how much I’ve enjoyed comp sci, especially because it is all very new to me and slightly challenging, though in sort of a fun, exciting way. Last week, I was able to get started coding my website and adding onto what Molly helped me make in class. This included finding a cool animated picture that resembled me to put onto the home page, and working text onto it, too. At first, I felt a little (a lot!) lost about where to begin and how to even start, but, through trial and error, I figured out how to position my text/picture in the places I wanted to. Though the website was a mess, I was very proud of my troubleshooting and trial/error work to get through the obstacles.<p>This past week, I had a lab with Molly and she helped me to create a table (without a border) to position my pictures/text in an even better way. I was feeling very good about it after the lab, but when I tried to continue this work on my own, I wasn’t having much success. However, I decided to just give myself 30-60 minutes to just sit down with it and work, which helped me push through and reorganize the site into this new format. I still have a long way to go, but I’m pleased with how I’ve pushed through a lot of challenges and really developed my knowledge of comp sci.

So far in comp sci we have pretty much mastered the basics of html and I have begun to really understand what each element means. From learning how to create a div, to styling that div, to being able to transition from that div to another, I really do understand the basics of such html elements. CSS is a language that I also am feeling relatively comfortable with, as it is the language used to style specific divs in html. I have figured out how to create an ombre background pattern, how to choose a color not specifically listed in html, and so much more. Javascript, on the other hand, is a language I am still learning the basics of; I have just recently begun to think of variables as sticky notes that are then labeled with any word/phrase of choice. Functions are then the verbs that are commanding those sticky notes and giving them actions to perform, with some form of help from the programmer (i.e., a key press, a click, a hover). Functions need to be called in order to run, so that is a key aspect of their existence too. <p>Event listeners are basically the specific verb that would describe a function. For example, you might add an event listener that would change a variable’s background color from blue to pink when clicked. And finally, the terminal is sort of the “behind the scenes” area for the computer’s console. Using a series of commands, you can enter into the various levels of the computer and, when inside your website, “save” it online, so that it will now appear when your link is clicked. These two things are still slightly confusing to me, along with javascript in general, but as I work and code more, I’m beginning to get more comfortable with the various commands.

Today, I was attempting to solve the problem of my code sketch alone, but to no avail. I was trying to get the box in my code sketch to randomly change a color whenever I pressed that white box on my screen, but I was only able to change the color once. This was because my code had determined that the color would change as my x and y coordinates of my clicks changed enough, but since there was too little variance between my clicks, there was no change in color. Working with Molly, I was able to restructure my code so that the value of the rgb colors (red, green, and blue) did not rely upon the x/y coordinate points. Now, one can click the white box and watch as the color box changes as much as they desire.

This week I created a little animation representing my flight to CA from NYC and back, with a little airplane continuously flying over a map of the US. I was proud of my use of resources on the internet to make the plane be able to turn around, change direction, and finish the round-trip flight. I was trying to add a javascript element to the codesketch in which you could click on the screen to pause the flight and then click again to resume the flight, but without success. I had found some code/explanations of toggle animation functions and attempted to implement that into my code sketch, but to no avail. It would be helpful to review event listeners and clicking functions to stop/start an animation/other function.

I had a rather frustrating week with my codesketch; after feeling really confident after class about arrays/event listeners/functions, I was excited to implement my own array, but encountered so many problems. My idea was to do a “choose your comfort food” array, with all sorts of fun teas, coffees, and snacks that would appear after every click, but I couldn’t figure out how to do it. I created my array, with my variable of food pointing towards the various images of my snacks, in brackets. My other variable, food choice, was designed to get the images when clicked, using an event listener. After our lesson on Monday on how to create a randomizer-function (using math.random, times the number of values you have in your array, and then using math.round to round the number to a whole value), I added this in to get a random image every time clicked, but with no success! My goal was to change the background image of my div/variable “foodchoice,” yet nothing seemed to work! My code seems to be exactly the same as Molly’s for her color randomizer, just with different variables, and yet it still doesn’t seem to be working. I tried to go into the console and input “food” to see if my values appeared, but it continued telling me that the variable food is undefined. I’m going to keep trying to troubleshoot over the weekend and hopefully figure out the issues next week.

This week, I was extremely successful with my forloop codesketch, creating a little whac-a-smiley-face mini game. I mostly copied the code from class time, but I understand how we created a div using javascript instead of html. Instead of creating a div in the body of the html script and styling it in the style section, one can do that using javascript instead! To start, we create a function entitled makeINSERT NAME HERE and then create a variable which we will point towards a div. Following this, we will add an id or class list to the variable and tell the computer to go into the document and identify this variable. Using javascript to create a div this way is particularly helpful if you want to create many, many, many copies of that same div. To do so, you can either set an interval for your function, meaning there will be a maximum number of divs created, or you can continuously add one div until your function reaches its maximum. To finish off this cool codesketch, complete with 5,000 smiley faces, I decided to add an event listener to this function, so the smiley faces could disappear when clicked on them. This worked marvelously.

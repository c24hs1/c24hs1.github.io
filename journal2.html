I’ve been surprised about how much I’ve enjoyed comp sci, especially because it is all very new to me and slightly challenging, though in sort of a fun, exciting way. Last week, I was able to get started coding my website and adding onto what Molly helped me make in class. This included finding a cool animated picture that resembled me to put onto the home page, and working text onto it, too. At first, I felt a little (a lot!) lost about where to begin and how to even start, but, through trial and error, I figured out how to position my text/picture in the places I wanted to. Though the website was a mess, I was very proud of my troubleshooting and trial/error work to get through the obstacles.<p>This past week, I had a lab with Molly and she helped me to create a table (without a border) to position my pictures/text in an even better way. I was feeling very good about it after the lab, but when I tried to continue this work on my own, I wasn’t having much success. However, I decided to just give myself 30-60 minutes to just sit down with it and work, which helped me push through and reorganize the site into this new format. I still have a long way to go, but I’m pleased with how I’ve pushed through a lot of challenges and really developed my knowledge of comp sci.

So far in comp sci we have pretty much mastered the basics of html and I have begun to really understand what each element means. From learning how to create a div, to styling that div, to being able to transition from that div to another, I really do understand the basics of such html elements. CSS is a language that I also am feeling relatively comfortable with, as it is the language used to style specific divs in html. I have figured out how to create an ombre background pattern, how to choose a color not specifically listed in html, and so much more. Javascript, on the other hand, is a language I am still learning the basics of; I have just recently begun to think of variables as sticky notes that are then labeled with any word/phrase of choice. Functions are then the verbs that are commanding those sticky notes and giving them actions to perform, with some form of help from the programmer (i.e., a key press, a click, a hover). Functions need to be called in order to run, so that is a key aspect of their existence too. <p>Event listeners are basically the specific verb that would describe a function. For example, you might add an event listener that would change a variable’s background color from blue to pink when clicked. And finally, the terminal is sort of the “behind the scenes” area for the computer’s console. Using a series of commands, you can enter into the various levels of the computer and, when inside your website, “save” it online, so that it will now appear when your link is clicked. These two things are still slightly confusing to me, along with javascript in general, but as I work and code more, I’m beginning to get more comfortable with the various commands.
